The solution involves carefully analyzing CSS specificity and correcting any syntax errors.  In the specificity example, you might need to add `!important` to less specific declarations to override more specific styles if necessary or refactor your CSS to use more efficient selectors. Always verify your selectors to make sure they are targeting the correct elements. Review the corrected `bugSolution.css` file for improved clarity and behavior:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#myElement {
  color: blue !important; /* Added !important to override */
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green;
}

/* Add more specific selectors where necessary */
```

In addition, correct any syntax errors as found in the original `bug.css` to ensure proper rendering.
Ensure your selectors are properly formed, and values are correctly specified. Using a CSS validator can help catch many syntax errors before runtime.
